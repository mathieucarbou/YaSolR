Detail for my Mk2_bothDisplays_1.ino sketch

This is the original sketch for use with by PCB-based hardware. 
It supports two current sensors.  CT1 is for monitoring the flow of 
energy at the supply point.  CT2 is available for monitoring the flow 
of current to the dump-load.  

The display can be driven in either of two ways.  A #define statement 
near the top of the sketch can be either included or commented out to 
achieve this selection.  If no display is in use, it doesn't matter 
which way the display code is configured; the driver logic will just 
rattle away in the background, un-noticed by the rest of the world.

If a complete system is purchased from me, this is the sketch that will
be pre-loaded into its processor.  Only the powerCal value(s) will have
been changed to match the associated hardware.

The two powerCal variables provides a convenient means of calibrating 
hardware for use with a Mk2 Router.  CT1 and CT2 each have separate 
powerCal variables, with the suffices _grid and _diverted respectively.
