/*
 * Tool to capture the raw samples generated by the Atmega 328P processor
 * during one or more mains cycles.  The data is displayed on the Serial Monitor. 
 *
 * The pin-allocations have been arranged to suit my PCB-based hardware for the 
 * 3-phase Mk2 PV Router.  The six analog ports of the Atmega 328 processor are assigned
 * to the three pairs of AC voltage and current measuring channels.
 * 
 * The voltage and current waveforms for phases L1, L2 and L3 respectively are denoted
 * '0' - '5' on the output display.
 *
 * The display is more compact if not every set of samples is shown.  This aspect
 * can be changed at the second of the two lines which contain a '%' character.  
 *
 * Pauses after each set of measurements has been taken.  Press 'g', then [cr], 
 * to repeat.
