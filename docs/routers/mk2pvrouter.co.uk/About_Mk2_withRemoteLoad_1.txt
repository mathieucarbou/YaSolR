Detail for my Mk2_withRemoteLoad_1.ino sketch

This is an upgraded version of the original Mk2 sketch for use with my
PCB-based hardware.  It still supports two current sensors, CT1 and CT2.  
CT1 is for monitoring the flow of energy at the supply point; CT2 is 
available for monitoring the flow of current to the primary dump-load.  

With this version, a secondary dump-load is supported, it being controlled 
by the on-board RF facility.  By using the pin-saving hardware option, 
the 4-digit display is still available for use.

The primary (wired) load is still controlled from the "trigger" port.  In 
this sketch, the "mode" port is now used for priority selection.  If the 
associated switch is open, the local (wired) load has priority.  If the
switch is closed, thereby shorting these pins together, the secondary 
(RF-controlled)load has priority.
