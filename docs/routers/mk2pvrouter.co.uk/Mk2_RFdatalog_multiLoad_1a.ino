/* Mk2_RFdatalog_multiLoad_1a.ino 
 *
 * This sketch is for diverting suplus PV power to one or two dump loads using 
 * triac-based output stages or Solid State Relays.  Routine datalogging is  
 * avalable if a suitable RF module is fitted (either RFM12B or RF69). A 4-digit display
 * showing the Diverted Energy each day is also supported.
 *
 * This sketch is intended for use with my PCB-based hardware for the Mk2 PV Router.  
 * The integral voltage sensor is fed from one of the secondary coils of the 
 * transformer.  Current is measured via Current Transformers at the 
 * CT1 and CT1 ports.  
 * 
 * CT1 is for 'grid' current, to be measured at the grid supply point.
 * CT2 is for the load current, so that diverted energy can be recorded
 *
 * A persistence-based 4-digit display is supported. When the RF module is 
 * in use, the display can only be used in conjunction with an extra pair of 
 * logic chips.  These are ICs 3 and 4, which reduce the number of processor pins 
 * that are needed to drive the display.
 *
 * This sketch is based on the Mk2i PV Router code that I have posted in on the 
 * OpenEnergyMonitor forum.  The original version, and other related material, 
 * can be found on my Summary Page at www.openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1757
 *
 * September 2014: renamed as Mk2_RFdatalog_3, with these changes:
 * - cycleCount removed (was not actually used in this sketch, but could have overflowed);
 * - tidier initialisation of display logic in setup();
 *
 * December 2014, upgraded to Mk2_RFdatalog_4:  
 *    This sketch has been restructured in order to make better use of the ISR.  All of 
 * the time-critical code is now contained within the ISR and its helper functions.  
 * Values for datalogging are transferred to the main code using a flag-based handshake 
 * mechanism.  The diversion of surplus power can no longer be affected by slower 
 * activities which may be running in the main code such as Serial statements and RF.  
 *    Temperature sensing is supported by re-allocating the "mode" port for this 
 * purpose. A pullup resistor (4K7 or similar) is required for the Dallas sensor.  The 
 * output mode, i.e. NORMAL or ANTI_FLICKER, is now set at compile time.
 * Also:
 * - The ADC is now in free-running mode, at ~104 us per conversion.
 * - a persistence check has been added for zero-crossing detection (polarityConfirmed)
 * - a lowestNoOfSampleSetsPerMainsCycle check has been added, to detect any disturbances
 * - Vrms has been added to the datalog payload (as Vrms x 100)
 * - temperature has been added to the datalog payload (as degrees C x 100)
 * - the phaseCal mechanism has been reinstated
 *
 * January 2016: renamed as Mk2_RFdatalog_4a, with a minor change in the ISR to reinstate
 *   the phaseCal calculation.  Previously, this feature was having no effect because 
 *   two assignment lines were in the wrong order.  When measuring "real power", which
 *   is what this application does, the phaseCal refinement has very little effect even
 *   when correctly implemented, as it now is.
 *   Support for the RF69 RF module has also been added.
 *
 * January 2016: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_4b:
 *   The variables to store copies of ADC results for use by the main code are now declared 
 *   as "volatile" to remove any possibility of incorrect operation due to optimisation 
 *   by the compiler.
 *
 * February 2016: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_5, with these changes:
 * - improvements to the start-up logic.  The start of normal operation is now 
 *    synchronised with the start of a new mains cycle.
 * - reduce the amount of feedback in the Low Pass Filter for removing the DC content
 *     from the Vsample stream. This resolves an anomaly which has been present since 
 *     the start of this project.  Although the amount of feedback has previously been 
 *     excessive, this anomaly has had minimal effect on the system's overall behaviour.
 * - tidying of the "confirmPolarity" logic to make its behaviour more clear
 * - SWEETZONE_IN_JOULES changed to WORKING_RANGE_IN_JOULES 
 * - change "triac" to "load" wherever appropriate
 *
 * March 2016: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_5a, with this change:
 * - RF capability made switchable so that the code will continue to run
 *   when an RF module is not fitted.  Dataloging can then take place 
 *   via the Serial port.   
 *   
 * October 2017: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_multiLoad_1, with these changes:  
 * - temperature sensing commented out(formally supported via D3 at the "mode" port")
 * - support for a second load added (vcontrolled via D3 at the "mode" port")

// Calibration values (not important for the Router's basic operation)
//-------------------
// For accurate calculation of real power/energy, two calibration values are 
// used: powerCal and phaseCal.  With most hardware, the default values are 
// likely to work fine without need for change.  A full explanation of each 
// of these values now follows:
//   
// powerCal is a floating point variable which is used for converting the 
// product of voltage and current samples into Watts.
//
// The correct value of powerCal is dependent on the hardware that is 
// in use.  For best resolution, the hardware should be configured so that the 
// voltage and current waveforms each span most of the ADC's usable range.  For 
// many systems, the maximum power that will need to be measured is around 3kW. 
//
// My sketch "MinAndMaxValues.ino" provides a good starting point for 
// system setup.  First arrange for the CT to be clipped around either core of a  
// cable which supplies a suitable load; then run the tool.  The resulting values 
// should sit nicely within the range 0-1023.  To allow some room for safety, 
// a margin of around 100 levels should be left at either end.  This gives a 
// output range of around 800 ADC levels, which is 80% of its usable range.
//
// My sketch "RawSamplesTool_2chan.ino" provides a one-shot visual display of the
// voltage and current waveforms.  This provides an easy way for the user to be 
// confident that their system has been set up correctly for the power levels 
// that are to be measured.  Any pre-built system that I supply will have been
// checked with this tool to ensure that the input sensors are working correctly.
//
// The ADC has an input range of 0-5V and an output range of 0-1023 levels.
// The purpose of each input sensor is to convert the measured parameter into a 
// low-voltage signal which fits nicely within the ADC's input range. 
//
// In the case of 230V mains voltage, the numerical value of the input signal 
// in Volts is likely to be fairly similar to the output signal in ADC levels.  
// 230V AC has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 651V, which is not far from the ideal 
// output range.  Stated more formally, the conversion rate of the overall system 
// for measuring VOLTAGE is likely to be around 1 ADC-step per Volt (RMS).
//
// In the case of AC current, however, the situation is very different.  At
// mains voltage, a power of 3kW corresponds to an RMS current of 12.5A which 
// has a peak-to-peak range of 35A.  This is smaller than the output signal by 
// around a factor of twenty.  The conversion rate of the overall system for 
// measuring CURRENT is therefore likely to be around 20 ADC-steps per Amp.
//
// When calculating "real power", which is what this code does, the individual 
// conversion rates for voltage and current are not of importance.  It is 
// only the conversion rate for POWER which is important.  This is the 
// product of the individual conversion rates for voltage and current.  It 
// therefore has the units of ADC-steps squared per Watt.  Most systems will
// have a power conversion rate of around 20 (ADC-steps squared per Watt).
// 
// powerCal is the RECIPR0CAL of the power conversion rate.  A good value 
// to start with is therefore 1/20 = 0.05 (Watts per ADC-step squared)
//
// for 3.3V operation, the optimum value is generally around 0.044
// for 5V operation, the optimum value is generally around 0.072
//

// phaseCal is used to alter the phase of the voltage waveform relative to the
// current waveform.  This mechanism can be used to offset any difference in 
// phase delay between the voltage and current sensors.  The algorithm interpolates 
// between the most recent pair of voltage samples according to the phaseCal value. 
//
//    With phaseCal = 1, the most recent sample is used.  
//    With phaseCal = 0, the previous sample is used
//    With phaseCal = 0.5, the mid-point (average) value is used
//
// Values ouside the 0 to 1 range involve extrapolation, rather than interpolation
// and are not recommended.  By altering the order in which V and I samples are 
// taken, and for how many loops they are stored, it should always be possible to
// arrange for the optimal value of phaseCal to lie within the range 0 to 1. 
//
// The calculation for real power is very insensitive to the value of phaseCal.   
// When a "real power" calculation is used to determine how much surplus energy 
// is available for diversion, a nominal value such as 1.0 is generally thought 
// to be sufficient for this purpose.
