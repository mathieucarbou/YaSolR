Detail for my cal_CT2_v_CT1.ino sketch

/* cal_CT2_v_CT1.ino 
 *
 * February 2018
 * This calibration sketch is based on Mk2_bothDisplays_4.ino. Its purpose is to
 * mimic the behaviour of a dual channel electricity meter. The sensitivity of the 
 * CT2 channel can then be adjusted to match that of the CT1 channel.  Before using
 * this sketch, the CT1 channel would normally have been calibrated against the
 * user's electricity meter.
 *
 * CT1 and CT2 should be fitted around the same current-carrying conductor. If 
 * CT2 has been built into a completed system, the bypass switch can be used to force 
 * power down that path. 
 *
 * The energy flow on each channel is noted and a short pulse is generated whenever a 
 * pre-set amount of energy has been recorded (normally 3600J). The two streams of 
 * pulses can then be compared. The pulse rate for the CT2 channel can be varied by
 * adjusting the value of powerCal_diverted.  When the two streams of pulses are in 
 * synch, correct calibration of the CT2 channel has been achieved.
 *
 * The two pulse streams can be synchronised at any time by earthing R11 which is
 * tracked to port A0 (aka D14).
