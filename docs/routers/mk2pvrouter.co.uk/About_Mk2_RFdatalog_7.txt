Detail for my Mk2_RFdatalog_7.ino sketch

 * This sketch is for diverting suplus PV power to a dump load using a triac 
 * or Solid State Relay.  Routine datalogging is also supported using the 
 * on-board RF module (either RFM12B or RF69).
 *
 * This sketch is intended for use with my PCB-based hardware for the Mk2 PV Router.  
 * The integral voltage sensor is fed from one of the secondary coils of the 
 * transformer.  Current is measured via Current Transformers at the 
 * CT1 and CT1 ports.  
 * 
 * CT1 is for 'grid' current, to be measured at the grid supply point.
 * CT2 is for the load current, so that diverted energy can be recorded
 *
 * A persistence-based 4-digit display is supported. When the RFM12B module is 
 * in use, the display can only be used in conjunction with an extra pair of 
 * logic chips.  These are ICs 3 and 4, which reduce the number of processor pins 
 * that are needed to drive the display.
 *
 * This sketch is based on the Mk2i PV Router code that I have posted in on the 
 * OpenEnergyMonitor forum.  The original version, and other related material, 
 * can be found on my Summary Page at www.openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1757
 *
 * September 2014: renamed as Mk2_RFdatalog_3, with these changes:
 * - cycleCount removed (was not actually used in this sketch, but could have overflowed);
 * - tidier initialisation of display logic in setup();
 *
 * December 2014, upgraded to Mk2_RFdatalog_4:  
 *    This sketch has been restructured in order to make better use of the ISR.  All of 
 * the time-critical code is now contained within the ISR and its helper functions.  
 * Values for datalogging are transferred to the main code using a flag-based handshake 
 * mechanism.  The diversion of surplus power can no longer be affected by slower 
 * activities which may be running in the main code such as Serial statements and RF.  
 *    Temperature sensing is supported by re-allocating the "mode" port for this 
 * purpose. A pullup resistor (4K7 or similar) is required for the Dallas sensor.  The 
 * output mode, i.e. NORMAL or ANTI_FLICKER, is now set at compile time.
 * Also:
 * - The ADC is now in free-running mode, at ~104 us per conversion.
 * - a persistence check has been added for zero-crossing detection (polarityConfirmed)
 * - a lowestNoOfSampleSetsPerMainsCycle check has been added, to detect any disturbances
 * - Vrms has been added to the datalog payload (as Vrms x 100)
 * - temperature has been added to the datalog payload (as degrees C x 100)
 * - the phaseCal mechanism has been reinstated
 *
 * January 2016: renamed as Mk2_RFdatalog_4a, with a minor change in the ISR to reinstate
 *   the phaseCal calculation.  Previously, this feature was having no effect because 
 *   two assignment lines were in the wrong order.  When measuring "real power", which
 *   is what this application does, the phaseCal refinement has very little effect even
 *   when correctly implemented, as it now is.
 *   Support for the RF69 RF module has also been added.
 *
 * January 2016: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_4b:
 *   The variables to store copies of ADC results for use by the main code are now declared 
 *   as "volatile" to remove any possibility of incorrect operation due to optimisation 
 *   by the compiler.
 *
 * February 2016: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_5, with these changes:
 * - improvements to the start-up logic.  The start of normal operation is now 
 *    synchronised with the start of a new mains cycle.
 * - reduce the amount of feedback in the Low Pass Filter for removing the DC content
 *     from the Vsample stream. This resolves an anomaly which has been present since 
 *     the start of this project.  Although the amount of feedback has previously been 
 *     excessive, this anomaly has had minimal effect on the system's overall behaviour.
 * - tidying of the "confirmPolarity" logic to make its behaviour more clear
 * - SWEETZONE_IN_JOULES changed to WORKING_RANGE_IN_JOULES 
 * - change "triac" to "load" wherever appropriate
 *
 * March 2016: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_5a, with this change:
 * - RF capability made switchable so that the code will continue to run
 *   when an RF module is not fitted.  Dataloging can then take place 
 *   via the Serial port.   
 *
 * November 2020: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_6, with these changes:
 * - the parameter cycleCountForDatalogging is now an "int" rather that a "byte".  This    
 * allows the datalogging period to be extended beyond 5 seconds without the counter 
 * running out of range.
 * - diverted energy, as monitored by CT2, is now reported as an average power as well as
 * the cumulative energy total for the current day.
 *
 * July  2022: updated to Mk2_RFdatalog_7, with this change:
 * - the datalogging accumulators for grid power, diverted power and Vsquared have been rescaled
 * to 1/16 of their previous values to avoid the risk of overflowing during a 10-second 
 * datalogging period.
