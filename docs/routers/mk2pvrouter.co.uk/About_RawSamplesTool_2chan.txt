/*
 * Tool to capture the raw samples generated by the Atmega 328P processor
 * during one or more mains cycles.  The data is displayed on the Serial Monitor, 
 * and is also available for subsequent processing using a spreadsheet. 
 *
 * This version is based on similar code that I posted in December 2012 on the 
 * OpenEnergyMonitor forum.  The original version, and other related material, 
 * can be found on my Summary Page at www.openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1757
 *
 * The pin-allocations have been changed to suit my PCB-based hardware for the 
 * Mk2 PV Router.  The integral voltage sensor is fed from one of the secondary 
 * coils of the transformer.  Current can be measured via Current Transformers 
 * at the CT1 and CT1 ports.  
 * 
 * Voltage samples are displayed as 'v'
 * Current samples via CT1 are displayed as '1'
 * Current samples via CT2 are displayed as '2'
 *
 * The display is more compact if not every set of samples is shown.  This aspect
 * can be changed at the second of the two lines which contain a '%' character.
