# YaSolR ?

YaSolR is an ESP32 firmware for **Solar Router** compatible with nearly **any existing hardware components**.

If you already have a Solar Router at home based on ESP32, built by yourself or someone else, there is a good chance that YaSolR will be compatible.

### Routing Outputs

YaSolR supports up to 2 outputs.
A routing output is connected to a resistive load and controls its power by dimming the voltage.
Each output is composed of the following components:

- [Dimmer (required)](#dimmer-required)
- [Bypass Relay (optional)](#bypass-relay-optional)
- [Temperature (optional)](#temperature-optional)
- [Measurement device (optional)](#measurement-device-optional)
- [Additional Output Features](#additional-output-features)

#### Dimmer (required)

A dimmer controls the power sent to the load.
Example of supported dimmers:

| Dimmer Type                                                                | `Phase Control` | `Burst Fire Control` (üöß) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------------------: |

| **Zero-Cross SSR** (üöß)<br> ![](./assets/img/hardware/SSR_40A_DA.jpeg)     |       ‚ùå        |            ‚úÖ             |
| **Voltage Regulator** (üöß)<br> ![](./assets/img/hardware/LSA-H3P50YB.jpeg) |       ‚úÖ        |            ‚úÖ             |

#### Bypass Relay (optional)

A bypass relay allows to force a heating at full power and bypass the dimmer at a given schedule or manually.
Keeping a dimmer `on` generates heat so a bypass relay can be installed to avoid using the dimmer.

**If a bypass relay is installed, the dimmer will be used instead and will be set to 0-100% to simulate the relay.**

#### Temperature (optional)

Measuring the temperature of the water tanker is important to ve able to trigger automatic heating based on temperature thresholds, or stop the routing if the temperature i reached.

This can also be done:

- using a remote temperature sensor through MQTT
- using a remote temperature sensor through ESP-Now (üöß)
- using one of the supported sensor:

|                    DS18B20                     |
| :--------------------------------------------: |
| ![DS18B20](./assets/img/hardware/DS18B20.jpeg) |

#### Measurement device (optional)

Each output supports an optional measurement device to measure the power routed to the load.

- `JSY-MK-194T`: has 2 clamps, and is used to monitor the aggregated routed output power (sum of the two outputs) and the grid power with the second clamp.
- `PZEM-004T V3`: can monitor each output independently. **It cannot be used to measure the grid power.**

|                     PZEM-004T V3                      |                       JSY-MK-194T                        |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![PZEM-004T V3](./assets/img/hardware/PZEM-004T.jpeg) | ![JSY-MK-194T](./assets/img/hardware/JSY-MK-194T_2.jpeg) |

#### Additional Output Features

- `Bypass Automatic Control` / `Manual Control`: Automatically force a heating as needed based on days, hours, temperature range, or control it manually
- `Dimmer Automatic Control` / `Manual Control`: Automatically send the grid excess to the resistive load through the dimmer (or manually control the dimmer yourself if disabled)
- `Independent or Sequential Outputs with Grid Excess Sharing`: Outputs are sequential by default (second output activated after first one at 100%).
  **Independent outputs are also supported** thanks to the sharing feature to split the excess between outputs.
  This feature is available in `Dimmer Automatic Control` mode.
- `Dimmer Duty Limiter`: Set a limit to the dimmer power to avoid routing too much power
- `Dimmer Temperature Limiter`: Set a limit to the dimmer to stop it when a temperature is reached. This temperature can be different than the temperature used in auto bypass mode.
- `Statistics`: Harmonic information, power factor, energy, routed power, etc
- `Automatic Resistance Calibration` (üöß): if a JSY or PZEM is installed, automatically discover and save the resistance value of the connected load.

### Grid Power Measurement

Measuring the grid power is essential to know how much power is available to route.
YaSolR supports many ways to measure the grid power and voltage:

**Mono-phase**:

- `MQTT` (**Home Assistant**, **Jeedom**, `Shelly EM`, etc)
- `JSY-MK-194T` (25 measurements / second)
- Remote `JSY-MK-194T` through **UDP** (20 measurements / second)
- Remote `JSY-MK-194T` through **ESP-Now** (üöß)

**3-Phase**:

- `MQTT` (**Home Assistant**, **Jeedom**, `Shelly 3EM`, etc)
- `JSY-MK-333` (üöß)
- Remote `JSY-MK-333` through **UDP** (üöß)
- Remote `JSY-MK-333` through **ESP-Now** (üöß)

### Relays

YaSolR supports up to 2 relays to control external resistive loads or contactors.

- Supports `NO / NC` relay type
- `Automatic Control` / `Manual Control`: You can specify the resistive load power in watts connected to the relay.
  If you do so, the relay will be automatically activated based on the excess power.

### Monitoring and Management

**Dashboard**:

- `Charts`: Live charts (grid power, routed power, THDi, PID tuning, etc)
- `Health`: configuration mistakes are detected as much as possible and issues displayed when a component was found to not properly work.
- `Languages (i18n)`: en / fr
- `LEDs`: Support LEDs for visual alerts
- `Manual Override`: Override anything remotely (MQTT, REST, Website)
- `GPIO`: A GPIO section shows the view of configured pins and activated pins, to report issues, duplications or invalid pins.
- `Restart`, `Factory Reset`, `Config Backup & Restore`, `Debug Logging`
- `Statistics`: Harmonic information, power factor, energy, routed power, grid power, grid frequency and voltage, etc
- `Web console`: View ESP logs live from a Web interface
- `Web OTA Firmware Update`: Update firmware through the Web interface

**Hardware**:

- `Display`: Support I2C OLED Display (`SSD1307`, `SH1106`, `SH1107`)
- `Push Button`: Support a push button to restart the device
- `Temperature Sensor`: Support a temperature rensor for the router box (`DS18B20`)

### MQTT, REST API and Home Automation Systems

The router exposes a lot of statistics and information through MQTT and REST API and provides a very good integration with Home Assistant or other home automation systems.
The router can be completely controlled remotely through a Home Automation System.

- `REST API`: extensive REST API support
- `MQTT`: extensive MQTT API (with `TLS` support)
- [Home Assistant Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery): Activate Home Assistant Auto Discovery to automatically create a YaSolR device in Home Assistant with all the sensors

### Online / Offline modes

- `Access Point Mode`: router can **work in AP mode without WiFi and Internet**
- `Admin Password`: to protect the website, API and Access Point
- `Captive Portal` a captive portal is started first time to help you connect the router
- `DNS & mDNS`: Discover the device on the network through mDNS (Bonjour) or DNS
- `Ethernet & Wifi`: **ESP32 boards with Ethernet and WiFi are supported**
- `NTP` support to synchronize time and date with Internet. If not activated, it is still possible to manually sync with your browser.
- `Offline Mode`: **The router can work without WiFi, even teh features requiring time and date.**

### PID Control and Tuning

The router uses a PID controller to control the dimmers and you have full control over the PID parameters to tune it.

Demo on Youtube:

[![PID Tuning in YaSolR (Yet Another Solar Router)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ygSpUxKYlUE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygSpUxKYlUE "PID Tuning in YaSolR (Yet Another Solar Router)")

### Virtual Excess and EV Charger Compatibility

Thanks to power measurement, the router also provides these features:

- `Virtual Excess`: Expose the virtual excess (MQTT, REST API, web) which is composed of the current excess plus the routing power
- `EV Charger Compatibility` (i.e OpenEVSE): Don't prevent an EV charge to start (router can have lower priority than an EV box to consume available production excess)

**A measurement device is required to use these features.**

## OSS vs PRO

OSS and Pro firmware are the same, except that the PRO version relies on commercial (paid) libraries and provides some additional features based on a better dashboard.

**The Pro version is only 25 euros** and gives access to all the perks of the Pro version below:

| Feature                          |                            OSS (Free)                            |                                                                                              PRO (Paid)                                                                                              |
